# RISC OS disassembly in Python

## Introduction

This repository contains the module used to disassemble ARM and Thumb code
for RISC OS Pyromaniac. It uses the Capstone library to do so, but modifies
the output so that the disassembly is in a form which is generally seen by
RISC OS users.


## Installation

The tool for disassembly can be installed manually using this repository
(see 'Usage' below) or through PyPI. To install, use:

    pip3 install riscos_disassemble


## Usage

Once installed, the tool can be invoked as `riscos-dumpi`. For example:

    riscos-dumpi examples/hello_world,ffc

The following switches are supported:

* `--thumb`: Disassembles Thumb code, rather than ARM code
* `--colour`: Uses the original primary and secondary ANSI colours.
* `--colour-8bit`: Use the more featureful 8bit colour palette.
* `--debuggerplus`: Specify a list of modifications to the debugger output,
  which originated in [DebuggerPlus](https://old-www.moreofthesa.me.uk/progs.utils.html).
* `--help-debuggerplus`: More information on the flags.
* `--function-map`: List the addresses for functions with signatures
* `--match`: Only disassemble functions with the given siganture, which may use wildcards.

The filename can be followed by a hexadecimal address to use as the base
address for the file's disassembly. By default the file will be based at
address 0 unless the file is suffixed by `,ff8` (an absolute file).

### DebuggerPlus

DebuggerPlus is a module by Darren Salt, which provides more options
for disassembly than the standard Debugger module provided by RISC OS.
These options were indicated by flags which could be set at the
command line. The `riscos-dumpi` tool supports a subset of those flags.

Supported flags:

* `ANDEQasDCD`: Use DCD instead of ANDEQ, MOV Rn,Rn (same register) etc.
* `APCS`: Use APCS-R register set.
* `Lower`: Force all register names to lower case.
* `QuoteSWIs`: Put quotes around SWI names.
* `UseDCD`: Use DCD instead of 'Undefined instruction', and BRK where DCD &x6000010 would be used.
* `UseNOP`: Use NOP instead of MOV R0,R0.
* `UseVDU`: Use VDU x instead of SWI OS_WriteI+x.

The flags may be specified on the command line with
`--debuggerplus=<flags>` repeated, or as a comma-separated list.
The flags may also be configured using the environment variable
`RISCOS_DUMPI_DEBUGGERPLUS`.

Flags prefixed by a `-` character will be disabled. This is useful to
disable the configuration in the environment variable, or those default
options. `Lower` is currently selected automatically by default.


## Use as a git text converter

If you have RISC OS binaries (or other ARM binaries) checked in to your Git
repository, it can be useful to be able to display and diff them. This can
be achieved by giving the binary files an attribute to indicate that they
should be converted to text first.

To mark the binary files, create a `.gitattributes` (or update your existing
file) with the attribute `diff=armbinary`. `armbinary` a label I have chosen
but you could use any name you preferred. For example:

    examples/*,* diff=armbinary

This indicates that any file containing a comma (`,`) within the `examples`
directory is to be converted through the `armbinary` conversion.

To tell Git how to perform the conversion it is necessary to update the
`.gitconfig` file to know how to perform the conversion.

    git config --global diff.armbinary.textconv "riscos-dumpi"

This indicates that when performing a diff (including `log -p` and others),
any files with the diff attribute `armbinary` will be passed to the `riscos-dumpi`
tool. You may prefer to use the colourised version of the disassembly, although
this will make it more difficult to see where changes are in diffs:

    git config --global diff.armbinary.textconv "riscos-dumpi --colour-8bit"

For more information on the Git attributes, see:
https://git-scm.com/docs/gitattributes#_performing_text_diffs_of_binary_files


## Requirements

The disassembly code requires the Capstone library to be installed. Capstone
4 is currently recommended, although later versions may function as well.

```
pip install 'capstone<5'
```


## Reuse

To use this in another project you would usually need to import the module
and subclass the `Disassemble` class to add functions necessary to access
memory and registers, and to decode SWI calls. However, if you do not care
about these things, the simplest usage can be found in the example script
`simple_disassemble.py`.

The `riscos-dumpi` tool is provided in the package and can be invoked
with:

    riscos-dumpi <options>

Or the tool can be manually invoked with:

    python -m riscos_disassemble <options>

This tool has more advanced support for the options than the simple example.

## Examples

Example files are supplied in the `examples` directory to demonstrate the disassembly:

* `hello_world` utility file (suffixed by `,ffc`) is a test from the RISC OS Pyromaniac project, which verifies the behaviour of the SWI `OS_Write0`.
* `osbyte81_version` utility file is another test program, which checks the behaviour of `OS_Byte &81` when reading the operating system version.
* `kerneldebug` utility file tests that the input and output in the kernel works, and has function signatures that are recognised.

Disassembling the example `hello_world` example is simple:

```
charles@laputa ~/riscos-disassemble-python $ riscos-dumpi examples/hello_world,ffc

```

The bulk of the disassembly is textual data, but this is still decoded as if it is
executable.
